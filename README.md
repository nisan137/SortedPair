# SortedPair
The rules of Sorted Pairs: 
A point will be considered smaller than another point if its x-component
is less than the x-component of the other point,
and its y-component is less than the y-component of the other pointn.
The point will be considered larger than the other point if
its x-component is greater than the x-component of the other point,
and its y-component is greater than the y-component of the other point.
In any other case, the points will be considered equal.
